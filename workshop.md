## Workshopping research questions

## Research Questions Activity

Break into groups of three or four people (smaller depending on attendance). Each group will receive an index card with a research question on it. These are all based on published work, but you need not be concerned if you don't recognize the source or know much about the subject. Your goal, as a pair or group, is to see how many of the following questions you can answer (or address) based on what is implied by the question itself.

1. What is the research question? Can it be divided into subtopics?

2. Would there be a way to look at texts (exploratory or confirmatory) to convert this question into a quantifiable answer? If so, how? If not, why not?

3. What factors might complicate or limit the role that computational text analysis might play in addressing your research question. These might be logistical (how do you identify verbs?) or conceptual (how do you measure agency?) or anything in between.

4. What would be some necessary considerations in designing a study? What kinds of texts would you need to be able to access or have collected, described, or categorized ahead of time? *A hint on texts: Don't worry about whether materials have been digitized at this stage. I'm imagining responses like "article about X from 18th century British periodicals"*

5. If you had to pursue this topic starting today, where would you begin? What do you know? What are the "known unknowns" that you would have to most immediately address?

Take up these questions for approximately 20 minutes. We will share ideas with everyone at the end.

*A note on causality: On my note cards, I've summarized research questions by saying things like "how did X affect Y." In most published work, scholars might start with these questions but provide responses that avoid claims of causality and say things like "soon after X happened, Y also happened," or "historically, X is associated with Y."*
